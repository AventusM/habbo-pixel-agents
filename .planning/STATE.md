## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Claude Code agents should feel like they're working together in a recognisable Habbo Hotel room — the isometric 2.5D aesthetic must be faithful to the classic v14 era.
**Current focus:** Ready for Phase 1

## Current Status

Initialization complete. Research done, requirements defined, roadmap created.

**Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 1` — Coordinate Foundation

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-28 | Fork pixel-agents, replace rendering layer only | Agent logic is correct and stable — only renderer changes |
| 2026-02-28 | Canvas 2D (not PixiJS/WebGL) for rendering | Zero overhead, sufficient for low-fps tile tool, matches existing codebase |
| 2026-02-28 | sphynxkitten/nitro-assets as primary asset source | Pre-extracted, no build-time SWF pipeline needed for V1 |
| 2026-02-28 | Build-time .nitro extraction via Node script | Never pass binary assets through esbuild |
| 2026-02-28 | OGG Vorbis for all audio | VS Code Electron ships without ffmpeg — MP3 decoding fails |
| 2026-02-28 | Press Start 2P as default font, Volter as opt-in | Volter is Sulake IP — default must be license-clean |
| 2026-02-28 | Never commit extracted Sulake assets to public repo | Low DMCA risk for personal tool, but keep assets local-only |
| 2026-02-28 | Simplified avatar sprites (3-4 layers) over full Habbo figure compositor | Full 13-layer body composition is out of scope for V1 |
| 2026-02-28 | useRef for all mutable render state in React | rAF loop closes over stale useState — useRef only |
| 2026-02-28 | Mault docs/specs/ excluded from fileProliferation + tempFiles detectors | GSD planning docs accumulate by design, not violations |
